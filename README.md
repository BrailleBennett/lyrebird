# lyrebird

An innocent discord bot that will never call `youtube-dl`

This application is dual licensed under the Apache license, version 2.0 or the MIT license, at your option.

# Features

 * Play anything that `yt-dlp` supports
 * Because it is self-hosted, the bot is yours, you can run it to keep it in voice 24/7 and there are no
limits in number of songs in queue.
 * Uses symphonia for decoding, does not need ffmpeg to work.
